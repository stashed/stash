                          If this field is used, the name returned to the client will be different

                          and may be truncated by the length of the suffix required to make the value
                          unique on the server.

                          volume is desired. This may be any object from a non-empty API group (non
                          core object) or a PersistentVolumeClaim object.
                          When this field is specified, volume binding will only succeed if the type of
                          the specified object matches some installed volume populator or dynamic
                          provisioner.
                          This field will replace the functionality of the dataSource field and as such
                          if both fields are non-empty, they must have the same value. For backwards
                          compatibility, when namespace isn't specified in dataSourceRef,
                          both fields (dataSource and dataSourceRef) will be set to the same
                          value automatically if one of them is empty and the other is non-empty.
                          When namespace is specified in dataSourceRef,
                          dataSource isn't set to the same value and must be empty.
                          There are three important differences between dataSource and dataSourceRef:
                          * While dataSource only allows two specific types of objects, dataSourceRef
                            allows any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim objects.
                          * While dataSource ignores disallowed values (dropping them), dataSourceRef
                            preserves all values, and generates an error if a disallowed value is
                            specified.
                          * While dataSource only allows local objects, dataSourceRef allows objects
                            in any namespaces.
                          (Beta) Using this field requires the AnyVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.
                          (Alpha) Using the namespace field of dataSourceRef requires the CrossNamespaceVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.

                                        MismatchLabelKeys is a set of pod label keys to select which pods will
                                        be taken into consideration. The keys are used to lookup values from the
                                        incoming pod labels, those key-value labels are merged with `labelSelector` as `key notin (value)`
                                        to select the group of existing pods which pods will be taken into consideration
                                        for the incoming pod's pod (anti) affinity. Keys that don't exist in the incoming
                                        pod labels will be ignored. The default value is empty.
                                        The same key is forbidden to exist in both mismatchLabelKeys and labelSelector.
                                        Also, mismatchLabelKeys cannot be set when labelSelector isn't set.
                                        This is an alpha field and requires enabling MatchLabelKeysInPodAffinity feature gate.

                                labelSelector spread as 2/2/1:
                                In this case, the global minimum is 1.

                                |  P P  |  P P  |   P   |
                                - if MaxSkew is 1, incoming pod can only be scheduled to zone3 to become 2/2/2;
                                scheduling it onto zone1(zone2) would make the ActualSkew(3-1) on zone1(zone2)
                                violate MaxSkew(1).
                                - if MaxSkew is 2, incoming pod can be scheduled onto any zone.
                                When `whenUnsatisfiable=ScheduleAnyway`, it is used to give higher precedence
                                to topologies that satisfy it.
                                It's a required field. Default value is 1 and 0 is not allowed.

                                MinDomains indicates a minimum number of eligible domains.
                                When the number of eligible domains with matching topology keys is less than minDomains,
                                Pod Topology Spread treats "global minimum" as 0, and then the calculation of Skew is performed.
                                And when the number of eligible domains with matching topology keys equals or greater than minDomains,
                                this value has no effect on scheduling.
                                As a result, when the number of eligible domains is less than minDomains,
                                scheduler won't schedule more than maxSkew Pods to those domains.
                                If value is nil, the constraint behaves as if MinDomains is equal to 1.
                                Valid values are integers greater than 0.
                                When value is not nil, WhenUnsatisfiable must be DoNotSchedule.

                                For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 2, MinDomains is set to 5 and pods with the same
                                labelSelector spread as 2/2/2:
                                | zone1 | zone2 | zone3 |
                                |  P P  |  P P  |  P P  |
                                The number of domains is less than 5(MinDomains), so "global minimum" is treated as 0.
                                In this situation, new pod with the same labelSelector cannot be scheduled,
                                because computed skew will be 3(3 - 0) if new Pod is scheduled to any of the three zones,
                                it will violate MaxSkew.

                                MaxSkew(1). In other words, the cluster can still be imbalanced, but scheduler

                                GenerateName is an optional prefix, used by the server, to generate a unique
                                name ONLY IF the Name field has not been provided.
                                If this field is used, the name returned to the client will be different
                                than the name passed. This value will also be combined with a unique suffix.
                                The provided value has the same validation rules as the Name field,
                                and may be truncated by the length of the suffix required to make the value
                                unique on the server.

                                If this field is specified and the generated name exists, the server will
                                NOT return a 409 - instead, it will either return 201 Created or 500 with Reason
                                ServerTimeout indicating a unique name could not be found in the time allotted, and the client
                                should retry (optionally after the time indicated in the Retry-After header).

                                Applied only if Name is not specified.

                                dataSourceRef specifies the object from which to populate the volume with data, if a non-empty
                                volume is desired. This may be any object from a non-empty API group (non
                                core object) or a PersistentVolumeClaim object.
                                When this field is specified, volume binding will only succeed if the type of

                                This field will replace the functionality of the dataSource field and as such
                                if both fields are non-empty, they must have the same value. For backwards
                                compatibility, when namespace isn't specified in dataSourceRef,
                                both fields (dataSource and dataSourceRef) will be set to the same
                                value automatically if one of them is empty and the other is non-empty.
                                When namespace is specified in dataSourceRef,
                                dataSource isn't set to the same value and must be empty.
                                There are three important differences between dataSource and dataSourceRef:
                                * While dataSource only allows two specific types of objects, dataSourceRef
                                  allows any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim objects.
                                * While dataSource ignores disallowed values (dropping them), dataSourceRef
                                  preserves all values, and generates an error if a disallowed value is
                                  specified.
                                * While dataSource only allows local objects, dataSourceRef allows objects
                                  in any namespaces.
                                (Beta) Using this field requires the AnyVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.
                                (Alpha) Using the namespace field of dataSourceRef requires the CrossNamespaceVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.
