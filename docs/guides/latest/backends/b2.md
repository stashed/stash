# Backblaze B2

Stash supports Backblaze's [B2 Cloud Storage](https://www.backblaze.com/b2/cloud-storage.html) as a backend. This tutorial will show you how to use this backend.

In order to use Backblaze B2 Cloud Storage as backend, you have to create a `Secret` and a `Repository` object pointing to the desired B2 bucket.

#### Create Storage Secret

To configure storage secret for this backend, following secret keys are needed:

|        Key        |    Type    |                         Description                         |
| ----------------- | ---------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `RESTIC_PASSWORD` | `Required` | Password that will be used to encrypt the backup snapshots. |
| `B2_ACCOUNT_ID`   | `Required` | Backblaze B2 account id.                                    |
| `B2_ACCOUNT_KEY`  | `Required` | Backblaze B2 account key.                                   |

Create storage secret as below,

```console
$ echo -n 'changeit' > RESTIC_PASSWORD
$ echo -n '<your-b2-account-id>' > B2_ACCOUNT_ID
$ echo -n '<your-b2-account-key>' > B2_ACCOUNT_KEY
$ kubectl create secret generic -n demo b2-secret \
    --from-file=./RESTIC_PASSWORD \
    --from-file=./B2_ACCOUNT_ID \
    --from-file=./B2_ACCOUNT_KEY
secret/b2-secret created
```

### Create Repository

Now, you have to create a `Repository` crd. You have to provide the storage secret that we have created earlier in `spec.backend.storageSecretName` field.

Following parameters are available for `b2` backend,

|      Parameter      |    Type    |                                                             Description                                                             |
| ------------------- | ---------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `b2.bucket`         | `Required` | Name of the B2 bucket.                                                                                                              |
| `b2.prefix`         | `Optional` | Path prefix inside the bucket where the backed up data will be stored.                                                              |
| `b2.maxConnections` | `Optional` | Maximum number of parallel connections to use for uploading backup data. By default, Stash will use maximum 5 parallel connections. |

Below, the YAML of a sample `Repository` crd that uses a B2 bucket as a backend.

```yaml
apiVersion: stash.appscode.com/v1alpha1
kind: Repository
metadata:
  name: b2-repo
  namespace: demo
spec:
  backend:
    b2:
      bucket: stash-backup
      prefix: /demo/deployment/my-deploy
    storageSecretName: b2-secret
```

Create the `Repository` we have shown above using the following command,

```console
$ kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/appscode/stash/0.8.3/docs/examples/guides/v1beta1/backends/b2.yaml
repository/b2-repo created
```

Now, we are ready to use this backend to backup our desired data using Stash.
