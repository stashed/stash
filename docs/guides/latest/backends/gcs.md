# Google Cloud Storage (GCS)

Stash supports [Google Cloud Storage(GCS)](https://cloud.google.com/storage/) as a backend. This tutorial will show you how to use this backend.

In order to use Google Cloud Storage as backend, you have to create a `Secret` and a `Repository` object pointing to the desired GCS bucket.

#### Create Storage Secret

To configure storage secret for this backend, following secret keys are needed:

|                Key                |    Type    |                         Description                         |
| --------------------------------- | ---------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `RESTIC_PASSWORD`                 | `Required` | Password that will be used to encrypt the backup snapshots. |
| `GOOGLE_PROJECT_ID`               | `Required` | Google Cloud project ID.                                    |
| `GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON_KEY` | `Required` | Google Cloud service account json key.                      |

Create storage secret as below,

```console
$ echo -n 'changeit' > RESTIC_PASSWORD
$ echo -n '<your-project-id>' > GOOGLE_PROJECT_ID
$ mv downloaded-sa-json.key > GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON_KEY
$ kubectl create secret generic -n demo gcs-secret \
    --from-file=./RESTIC_PASSWORD \
    --from-file=./GOOGLE_PROJECT_ID \
    --from-file=./GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON_KEY
secret/gcs-secret created
```

### Create Repository

Now, you have to create a `Repository` crd. You have to provide the storage secret that we have created earlier in `spec.backend.storageSecretName` field.

Following parameters are available for `gcs` backend.

|      Parameter       |    Type    |                                                                                                                    Description                                                                                                                     |
| -------------------- | ---------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `gcs.bucket`         | `Required` | Name of Bucket. If the bucket does not exist yet, it will be created in the default location (US). It is not possible at the moment for Stash to create a new bucket in a different location, so you need to create it using Google cloud console. |
| `gcs.prefix`         | `Optional` | Path prefix inside the bucket where backed up data will be stored.                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| `gcs.maxConnections` | `Optional` | Maximum number of parallel connections to use for uploading backup data. By default, Stash will use maximum 5 parallel connections.                                                                                                                |

Below, the YAML of a sample `Repository` crd that uses a GCS bucket as a backend.

```yaml
apiVersion: stash.appscode.com/v1alpha1
kind: Repository
metadata:
  name: gcs-repo
  namespace: demo
spec:
  backend:
    gcs:
      bucket: stash-backup
      prefix: /demo/deployment/my-deploy
    storageSecretName: gcs-secret
```

Create the `Repository` we have shown above using the following command,

```console
$ kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/appscode/stash/0.8.3/docs/examples/guides/v1beta1/backends/gcs.yaml
repository/gcs-repo created
```

Now, we are ready to use this backend to backup our desired data using Stash.
